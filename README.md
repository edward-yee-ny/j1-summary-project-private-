## Classes 

VVVV We should prob class diagram that stuff gang VVVV

pls change when decided on whether stats should be a separate class or just internal attribute
```mermaid
classDiagram
    Room <|-- Treasure
    Room <|-- Battle
    Room <|-- Boss
    Room : +right()
    Room : +forward()
    Room : +left()
```
```mermaid
classDiagram
    Map : -head
    Map : +get_map()
    Map : +update_map()
```
```mermaid
classDiagram
    Entity <|-- Player
    Entity <|-- Monster
    Entity : -health
    Entity : -attack
    Player : -inventory
    Player : +open_inventory()
```

## Gameplay

- Gameplay is mainly turn-based with events that occur upon reaching new stages within this MUD
- Options are given and can be chosen by typing in the corresponding number

```bash
For example:
Would you like to
1. Move Left
2. Move Right
3. Move Forward
Choose your option: <choice>
```

### Movement

- From the starting room, you are allowed to move to the left, forward, or right.
- You will be provided with which directions you are allowed to move in
- However, you will not be able to know which room that you will be moving into

### Combat

- Combat is a turn-based system where you are able to fight with monsters
- You are able to utilise weapons and weapons provide additional damage (maybe additional effects)
- You will also be able to use your inventory
- Using your inventory will not count toward ending your turn, and you can only use items when it is your turn
